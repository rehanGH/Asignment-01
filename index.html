      Hunger is a serious human need. It is crucial to eat each day and to have a
      well-balanced diet in order to grow normally, have energy and enjoy overall
      good health. To go without a meal or food for a day leads to hunger pains and
      weakness; going without sufficient food for longer periods leads to deficiency
      disease; and going without food for the long term leads to starvation and ultimately death..

      Hunger is not only an affliction of the poor, but also the victims of natural disasters,
      those unable to work, the oppressed and the displaced

        We should all provide food for the poor. So many families die every day of starvation
        while we waste our food. Everyone needs food, otherwise how are we meant to survive?
        If we don’t have food to keep us moving and staying healthy its not possible to work
        and make a living for ourselves and our families. Everyone should have the right to
        live a healthy life especially when there are tones of food being wasted every year.
        Thousands of people are dying because of hunger.
